## tuple 
- tuples are same as list but immutable, that is cannot perform more action on tuple as they not changable.
- Tuples although can be multiplied with another tuple.
- Tuple can contain diverse data types same as lists.
- my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')
- Tuples support various operations such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation, just like lists. You can access      elements  of a tuple using square brackets and the index of the element you want to access:
- print(my_tuple[0])
- print(my_tuple[2:5])
- my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
multiplied_tuple = my_tuple * 3  # Multiply the tuple by 3
print(multiplied_tuple)
- count() - my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)
print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 3
- index() - my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple.index(3))  # Output: 2
